# Cracking The Coding Interview `Exercise 1.7 Rotate Matrix`
**`Rotate Matrix:`** Given an image represented by an NxN matrix, where each pixel in the image is 4
bytes, write a method to rotate the image by 90 degrees. (an you do this in place)

## `Description`
In this exercise we want to create a program that can manipulate images. 
To be more specific, we want to create a program that can rotate an image 90 degrees. 
In order to accomplish that task, we are going to have to represent the image in a way that the computer can understand. 

In this case we will use a matrix to represent the image. Once we have the image in matrix form, 
then we can use linear algebra in order to rotate the image.
