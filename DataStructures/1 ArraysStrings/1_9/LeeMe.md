# Cracking The Coding Interview Exercise 1.9 String Rotation

String Rotation: Assume you have a method isSubst ring which checks if one word is a substring
of another. Given two strings, 51 and 52, write code to check if 52 is a rotation of 51 using only one
call to isSubstring (e.g., "waterbottle" is a rotation of"erbottlewat").

## Description
In this exercise we want to see if the characters in two strings are the same. 

# Solution
