# Cracking The Coding Interview `Exercise 1.8 Zero Matrix`
**`Zero Matrix:`** Write an algorithm such that if an element in an MxN matrix is 0, its entire row and
column are set to O.

## `Description`
In this exercise, we want to create a program that can set rows and columns to zero based on the values of a given cell. This can be useful in order to work on more complex processes and operations 
in linear algebra.
