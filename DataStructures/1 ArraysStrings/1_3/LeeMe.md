#  Decifrando La Entrevista De Programacion Ejercicio 1.3 URLificar (Cracking The Coding Interview)
URLify: Write a method to replace all spaces in a string with '%20: You may assume that the string
has sufficient space at the end to hold the additional characters, and that you are given the "true"
length of the string. (Note: If implementing in Java, please use a character array so that you can
perform this operation in place.)
EXAMPLE
Input: "Mr John Smith ", 13
Output: "Mr%20J ohn%20Smith"

## Description
In this problem we want to create a program that can take a string as an input, 
and return URL compatible output. One of the most important details to take into account,
is the fact that URLs can not have spaces between characters. 

In order to solve that problem, the spaces must be substituted by the character combination of %20.
