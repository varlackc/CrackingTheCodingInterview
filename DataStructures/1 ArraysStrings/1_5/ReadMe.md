# Cracking The Coding Interview `Exercise 1.5 One Away`
**`One Away:`** There are three types of edits that can be performed on strings: insert a character,
remove a character, or replace a character. Given two strings, write a function to check if they are
one edit (or zero edits) away.

EXAMPLE

pales. pale -> true
pale. bale -> true
pale. bake -> false
