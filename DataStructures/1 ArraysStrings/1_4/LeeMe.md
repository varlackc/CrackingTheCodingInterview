# Cracking The Coding Interview Exercise 1.4 Palindrome Permutation
Palindrome Permutation: Given a string, write a function to check if it is a permutation of a palindrome.
A palindrome is a word or phrase that is the same forwards and backwards. A permutation
is a rea rrangement of letters. The palindrome does not need to be limited to just dictionary words.
EXAMPLE
Input: Tact Coa
Output: True (permutations: "taco cat". "atco cta". etc.)

## Description
In order to create this program we first must have an idea of the problem that we are trying to solve. The first step is to undestand what is a palindrome. We can think of a palindrom as a 
word that can be written the same way weather the text is read from left to right or from right to left.
