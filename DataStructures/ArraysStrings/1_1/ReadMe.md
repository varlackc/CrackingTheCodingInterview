# Cracking The Coding Interview Exercise 1.1 Is Unique

## Description
In this exercise the user needs to implement an algorithm to determine if a string has all unique characters. In addition, the user must try to solve the problem without using any additional data structures outside of arrays. 

# Solution
In this case we have to take into account that in some programming languages, strings are immutable. 
This means that in order to display a modified version of the string, a new version of the string must be created. 

In order to solve that problem, some of those languages use either a character array, or a string array. Since the data in the array can be modified, operations on the elements of the array can be made in order to solve string problems.
