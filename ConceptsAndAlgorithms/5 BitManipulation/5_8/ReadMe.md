# Cracking The Coding Interview `Exercise 5.8 Draw Line`

A monochrome screen is stored as a single array of bytes, allowing eight consecutive
pixels to be stored in one byte. The screen has width w, where w is divisible by 8 (that is, no byte will
be split across rows). The height of the screen, of course, can be derived from the length of the array
and the width. Implement a function that draws a horizontal line from (xl, y) to (x2 J y) .
The method signature should look something like:
drawLine(byte[] screen, int width, int xl, int x2, int y)
