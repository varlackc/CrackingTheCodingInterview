# Cracking The Coding Interview `Exercise 8.2 Robot in a Grid`

Imagine a robot sitting on the upper left corner of a grid with r rows and c columns. The robot can only move in two directions, right and down, but certain cells are "off limits" such that the robot cannot step on them. Design an algorithm to find a path for the robot from the top left to the bottom right.

## `Description`

The problem involves finding a path for a robot to move from the top left corner of a grid to the bottom right corner. The robot can only move right or down and cannot step on certain cells that are marked as "off limits". The task is to design an algorithm to find a valid path for the robot.
